## Background
(What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?)

For all my websites, I need to create a database, host a backend service and connect to my contact form. Then I thought of building an app where I can manage all my databases in a single place. So, I can directly use their APIs to store my data. So, we created fastdbaccess to organize and manage your database in a single place.


### How I built it
(How did you utilize MongoDB Atlas? Did you learn something new along the way? Pick up a new skill?)

I have some experience in building projects with MongoDB atlas. When it comes to this project "fastdbaccess". I used a free plan of MongoDB cloud. Through this hackathon, I get to know how search functionality works and real-time streaming. In this project, I haven't used any of those. I tried a simple way. So, this project is under Choose Your own Adventure.
